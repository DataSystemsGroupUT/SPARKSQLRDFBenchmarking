- Note: We share all the [scirpts](https://github.com/DataSystemsGroupUT/SPARKSQLRDFBenchmarking/tree/master/Scripts) that we used in our benchmaking experiments to make all computations and analysis as well as plotting all the figures over the logs of the experiments.
- Results sheets of these scripts calculations are also shared [here](https://github.com/DataSystemsGroupUT/SPARKSQLRDFBenchmarking/tree/master/results) in the reposiory.
