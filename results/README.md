### Resutls

In these sheets you can find, the execuation running times of queries for the different dimensions, i.e stroage, relational schema, and partitioning techniques
Followed by the rank tables, in the final sheet you can find the ranking scores for each dimention.

This is can be found for all the datsets (100M, 250M, and 500M).

In the other workbook, you can find the tables of comparing the ranking criteria, and combined ranking criteria. In \ddition to a atble of the best and 
worst configuration combinations (schema, partitioning, storage backends).

----

For our experiments for the phase #4 comparing the optimized relational schemata to the baseline ones, i.e WPT Vs PT schema and ExtVP vs. VP schemas  in presensce of Partitioning and Different storage formats, we uploaded here a combibned sheet of the runtimes logs as well as final results.
