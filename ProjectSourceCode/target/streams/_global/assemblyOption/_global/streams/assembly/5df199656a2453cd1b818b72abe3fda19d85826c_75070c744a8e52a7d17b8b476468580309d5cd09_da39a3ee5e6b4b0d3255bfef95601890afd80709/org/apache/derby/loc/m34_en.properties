XSDFK.S=Error encountered while trying to remove a jar file {0} stored in the database. Incorrect file or directory ownership or permissions could cause remove of the file to fail.  Processes not controlled by Derby like backup or virus checkers could also be responsible.
XSDAP.S=Unexpected no space error while attempting to update a row on page {0}. Values of internal fields at time of error are as follows\: slot \= {2}, recordId \= {3}, newColumnList \= {4}, nextColumn \= {5}, mode \= {6}, nextPortionHandle \= {7}, page dump \= {1}.

XBM07.D=Startup failed. Boot password must be at least 8 bytes long.
X0Y58.S=Attempt to add a primary key constraint to table ''{0}'' failed because the table already has a constraint of that type.  A table can only have a single primary key constraint.
42XAO=Subqueries are not allowed in the WHEN [ NOT ] MATCHED clauses of MERGE statements.
XBCA0.S=Cannot create new object with key {1} in {0} cache. The object already exists in the cache.

XSRS0.S=Cannot freeze the database after it is already frozen.
XCL25.S=Parameter {0} cannot be registered to be of type {1} because it maps to type {2} and they are incompatible.
X0X95.S=Operation ''{0}'' cannot be performed on object ''{1}'' because there is an open ResultSet dependent on that object.
