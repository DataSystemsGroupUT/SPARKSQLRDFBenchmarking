This is the DTD defining the Java Data Objects 1.0 metadata.

The metadata must declare all persistence-capable classes. If any
field declarations are not provided in the metadata, then field
metadata is defaulted for the missing field declarations.
Therefore, the JDO implementation is able to determine based on the
metadata whether a class is persistence-capable or not.
Any class not known to be persistence-capable by the JDO
specification (for example, java.lang.Integer) and not explicitly
named in the metadata is not persistence-capable.

The metadata associated with each persistence capable class must
be contained within a file, and its format is as defined in the DTD.
If the metadata is for only one class, then its file name should be
<class-name>.jdo. If the metadata is for a package, then its file name
should be <package-name>.jdo. For portability, files should be
available via resources loaded by the same class loader as the class.
These rules apply both to enhancement and to runtime.

The metadata is used both at enhancement time and at runtime.
Information required at enhancement time is a subset of the information
needed at runtime.
