XJ050.U=Database requires upgrade from version {0}, set the attribute ''upgrade\=true'' on the JDBC connection URL to allow upgrade to version {1}.
A020=Invalid authentication.
XSLA1.D=Log Record has been sent to the stream, but it cannot be applied to the store (Object {0}).  This may cause recovery problems also.

XSDB8.D=Warning\: Derby (instance {0}) is attempting to boot the database {1} even though Derby (instance {2}) may still be active.  Only one instance of Derby should boot a database at a time. Severe and non-recoverable corruption can result if 2 instances of Derby boot on the same database at the same time.  The derby.database.forceDatabaseLock\=true property has been set, so the database will not boot until the db.lck is no longer present.  Normally this file is removed when the first instance of Derby to boot on the database exits, but it may be left behind in some shutdowns.  It will be necessary to remove the file by hand in that case.  It is important to verify that no other VM is accessing the database before deleting the db.lck file by hand.

The procedure will not overwrite an existing file, even if the process has permissions to write to that file, due to security concerns, and to avoid accidental file damage. Please either change the output file name in the procedure arguments to specify a file which does not exist, or delete the existing file, then retry the operation.
42ZB5=Class ''{0}'' implements VTICosting but does not provide a public, no-argument constructor.
