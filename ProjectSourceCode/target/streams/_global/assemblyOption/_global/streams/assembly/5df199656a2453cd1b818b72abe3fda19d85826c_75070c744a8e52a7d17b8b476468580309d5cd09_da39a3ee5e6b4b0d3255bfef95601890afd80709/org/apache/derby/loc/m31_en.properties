XBCXH.S=The encryptionAlgorithm ''{0}'' is not in the correct format. The correct format is algorithm/feedbackMode/NoPadding.
XCL40.S=The delete rule of foreign key cannot be CASCADE. (The relationship would form a cycle that would cause a table to be delete-connected to itself. One of the existing delete rules in the cycle is not CASCADE, so this relationship may be definable if the delete rule is not CASCADE.)
