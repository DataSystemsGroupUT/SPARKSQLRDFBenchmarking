For reporoducability, we upload the 100K triples dataset (as a sample). 
- In particular, we upload here the native RDF file (n3).
- the converted TDB files.
- the relational schema files generated from querying the TDB datasets (CSV), along side with the converted other file formats (AVro, Parquet, ORC).
