## Datasets Preprocessing, Schema Generation, File Formats Conversion, and DBs (Hive/PostgreSQL) Queries

For reporoducability, we upload the 100K triples dataset (as a sample). 
- In particular, we upload here the native RDF file (n3).
- the converted TDB files.
- the relational schema files generated from querying the TDB datasets (CSV), along side with the converted other file formats (AVro, Parquet, ORC).

We upload here also the Hive DB Tables Creation and DataLoading queries(HiveQueriesLoading). We also, upload the TDB SPARQL queries that will generated the CSV files of the different relational schemas (ST, VT, and PT). For the centeralized (single machine) experiments, PostgreSQL was used and here you can find also tables creation , and data loading in postgreSQL.
