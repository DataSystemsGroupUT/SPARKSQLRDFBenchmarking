### Experiments Scripts

The Following directory include full scripts we used in our benchmaking experiments to make all computations and analysis as well as plotting all the figures over the logs of the experiments. Theses scdripts are as follows:

- **RDFscripts**: Averages the result of experiments, and saves the averaged results into excel file.
- **RankTable_RankScore**: Creates rank tables and rank score tables for partitioning techniques, storage formats, relational schemas, and configuration tables.
- **Plot_rank_scores**: Creates plots for rank score of Partitioning techniques, relational schemas, and storage backends.
- **Plot_Storage_Formats**: Creates plots for query execution run time for storage format comparison.
